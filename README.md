# Agentic

> A nervous system for research and development — not a tool, an operator.

Agentic is a persistent, event-driven platform that manages, guards, and orchestrates work across the Rift Realms project ecosystem. It bridges Claude Code (the hands) with a standalone Python service (the heartbeat), creating a dual OS where agents autonomously maintain, test, and explore while a human architect steers.

├── Skills, memory, slash commands   ├── FastAPI server (port 8750)
├── Git hooks → emit file events     ├── Vector store (persistent memory)
├── Agent browser → interact w/ UI   ├── Event queue (hook consumer)
├── CLI → spawn/manage agents        ├── Agent loop (spawn, monitor, digest)
│                                    └── State manager (tracks everything)
└────────── API + file bridge ───────┘
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests numpy

# Start the platform
python core/server.py
# → Dashboard at http://localhost:8750

# Check status (no server needed)
python core/server.py --status

# Install hooks in a connected repo
python hooks/install.py /path/to/your/repo
```

## Agent Types

| Agent | Role | Triggers |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Guardian** | Runs tests after changes, reports failures by severity tier | `file_changed`, `commit` |
| **Probe** | Runs experiments, interprets results against hypotheses | `experiment_requested` |
| **Synthesis** | Finds patterns across repos, flags stale connections | `experiment_completed`, `timer_daily` |
| **Maintenance** | Cleans up — dead code, dependency drift, stale indexes | `timer_nightly`, `maintenance_requested` |
| **Documentation** | Keeps README, indexes, and narrative framing current | `timer_30min`, `file_changed` |

## Test Tiering

Not all tests are equal. The guardian classifies failures by what actually broke:

| Tier | What it means | Dashboard severity |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Gold** | Something structural broke — a roundtrip fails, a simulation diverges, a multi-step process doesn't converge | `action_required` |
| **Silver** | A derived computation changed — a formula that should produce a known value doesn't | `warning` |
| **Bronze** | A constant doesn't equal itself — catches typos, not real breaks | `info` |

New or unclassified tests default to Gold. Better to over-alert than miss a real break.

## The Experiment: Agentic Cartography

The platform's first experiment asks: **can an agentic loop, given only observations about distinction (not our specific map), derive a self-consistent algebraic structure?**

### Seed Observations (no constants, no named structures)
- A unary logical position is incoherent — to say "I am" already presupposes "I am not" and the act of choosing between them. Identity requires difference. Claiming to be one thing with no outside is more radical than seeing a bigger picture, because it pretends a distinction hasn't been made when it has.
- Defining one thing creates three: the thing, its complement, and the distinction itself
- Binary distinction creates four states: neither, A, B, both
- The boundary between things is itself a thing
- A circle has two sides but one boundary
- Counting requires memory
- Symmetry is cheaper than asymmetry
- A knot that looks trivial locally can be non-trivial globally
- Any self-referential system must contain a fixed point

### 17 Required Properties
Any structure the loop discovers must be:

1. **Invariant** — forced by the math, not chosen by the designer
2. **Spectral** — built on eigenvalues, not coordinates
3. **Semantically mappable** — concepts attach to the algebra naturally
4. **Self-encoding** — can represent data about itself, on itself
5. **Time-like** — has a clock, irreversibility, sequence
6. **Space-like** — has neighbors, adjacency, locality
7. **Physics-like** — has conservation laws and symmetry breaking
8. **Logic-gated** — makes discrete decisions
9. **Self-recursive** — its own operator applies to its own output
10. **Living** — thermodynamic, not static
11. **Bridges discrete and continuous** — lattice embeds in continuum
12. **LLM-compatible** — can consume and produce embeddings
13. **Maps onto known structures** — discovers, doesn't invent
14. **Dimensionless ratios first** — pure numbers before units
15. **Geometrically grounded** — dimensionless quantities anchored on unit sphere
16. **Shape memory** — deformations remember their origin
17. **Topological-spectral** — connectivity meets eigenvalues

### Results So Far

| Probe | Structure Found | Properties | Checks |
|-------|----------------|------------|--------|
| cartography_001 | Distinction Algebra | 12/17 | ? |

Probe 001 started from "defining one thing creates three" and "the boundary is a thing." From those two observations alone, it derived a 9-state algebra with three logic gates (identity, flip, reset), a spectral gap of 1/3, and an irreversible drift toward the boundary — everything decays into the distinction itself. 12 of 17 properties confirmed, 19/19 quantitative checks passed. See [derivation_001.md](experiments/runs/cartography_001/derivation_001.md) for the full reasoning chain.

## Agent-Human Precedence

```
Human intent  >  CLAUDE.md rules  >  Agent judgment  >  Automation defaults
```

- **Human = Architect**: defines intent, assigns meaning, approves gates
- **Agents = Operators**: propose findings, escalate ambiguity, stop when stuck
- Agents may autonomously run tests, index files, and generate reports
- Agents must ask before modifying code, closing issues, pushing, or deleting anything

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full precedence hierarchy.
